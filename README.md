# Day 4: Data Understanding & Structuring

## 🎯 Objective
To deeply understand hiring data and convert unstructured content (resumes and job descriptions) into structuredAI-ready JSON forma. This enables better matching algorithms, automated screening, and structured data analysis.
## 🏗️ Data Entity Definitions
To ensure consistency across the AI model, we have defined four standard data entities:
| Entity | Description |
|---|---|
Candidate Profile| The root entity representing an individual's professional identity and contact info. |
Job Profile| The root entity representing a specific job opening and its requirements. |
Skill Object| A granular unit containing the skill name, proficiency level, and years of usage. |
Experience Object| A structured block for work history including title, company, duration, and key impact. |
## 📄 JSON Schema Designs
### 1. Resume Structured Schema
This schema transforms a standard resume into a machine-readable format.
```json
{
  "candidate_profile": {
    "personal_info": {
      "full_name": "string",
      "email": "string",
      "phone": "string",
      "location": { "city": "string", "country": "string" }
    },
    "education": [
      {

        "years_of_experience": "float"
      }
    ],
    "certifications": ["string"]
  }
}

```
### 2. Job Description (JD) Schema
Designed to capture the core requirements and metadata of a vacancy.
```json
{
  "job_profile": {
    "metadata": {
      "job_id": "string",
      "title": "string",
      "department": "string",

{
  "job_metadata": {
    "role": "Data Scientist",
    "seniority": "Mid-Level"
  },
  "requirements": {
    "mandatory_skills": ["Python", "SQL", "Machine Learning"],
    "experience_years": { "min": 3, "max": 5 },
    "education": "Master's in CS or related field"
  }
}

---

🔢 Signal Definitions

Signal| Description
Confidence| Based on hesitation, repetition, uncertainty, pause
Sentiment| Emotional tone (positive/negative)
Stress| Nervous language indicators
Contradiction| Logical inconsistency in response

---

⚠️ Industry-Level Fixes Applied

1. ✅ Normalization

All module outputs are standardized to 0–100, then normalized to 0–1 before aggregation.

---

2. ✅ Improved Weighting

Weights adjusted to reflect real-world importance of signals:

- Confidence → Primary indicator
- Sentiment → Secondary emotional signal
- Stress → Behavioral modifier
- Contradiction → Logical penalty

---

3. ✅ Contradiction Integration

Previously ignored, now directly impacts final score.

---

4. ✅ Advanced Confidence Calculation

Confidence is computed using weighted penalties:

- Hesitation
- Uncertainty
- Repetition
- Speech rate deviation

---

5. ⚠️ Oversimplified Scoring Fixed

Replaced equal averaging with weighted scoring model.

---

🧪 Example Usage

from app.services.stress_conf_analyzer36.behavior_analyzer import analyze_behavior

text = "I think I am confident but maybe I need improvement"
duration = 6

result = analyze_behavior(text, duration)
print(result)

---

Instead of relying only on static scoring systems, the platform now supports:

- Decision refinement
- Risk-aware optimization
- Consistency validation
- False positive reduction
- Intent-aware evaluation
- Performance optimization

This stage significantly improves the reliability, explainability, and enterprise readiness of the AI hiring platform.

The architecture prepares the system for future adaptive AI learning, real-time optimization pipelines, and intelligent recruiter feedback systems capable of continuously improving hiring decision quality at scale.
