# Day 4: Data Understanding & Structuring

## 🎯 Objective
To deeply understand hiring data and convert unstructured content (resumes and job descriptions) into structuredAI-ready JSON forma. This enables better matching algorithms, automated screening, and structured data analysis.
## 🏗️ Data Entity Definitions
To ensure consistency across the AI model, we have defined four standard data entities:
| Entity | Description |
|---|---|
Candidate Profile| The root entity representing an individual's professional identity and contact info. |
Job Profile| The root entity representing a specific job opening and its requirements. |
Skill Object| A granular unit containing the skill name, proficiency level, and years of usage. |
Experience Object| A structured block for work history including title, company, duration, and key impact. |
## 📄 JSON Schema Designs
### 1. Resume Structured Schema
This schema transforms a standard resume into a machine-readable format.
```json
{
  "candidate_profile": {
    "personal_info": {
      "full_name": "string",
      "email": "string",
      "phone": "string",
      "location": { "city": "string", "country": "string" }
    },
    "education": [
      {
        "institution": "string",
        "degree": "string",
        "field_of_study": "string",
        "completion_year": "integer"
      }
    ],
    "experience": [
      {
        "job_title": "string",
        "company": "string",
        "start_date": "ISO8601",
        "end_date": "ISO8601/null",
        "responsibilities": ["string"],
        "achievements": ["string"]
      }
    ],
    "skills": [
      {
        "name": "string",
        "level": "Beginner/Intermediate/Expert",
        "years_of_experience": "float"
      }
    ],
    "certifications": ["string"]
  }
}

```
### 2. Job Description (JD) Schema
Designed to capture the core requirements and metadata of a vacancy.
```json
{
  "job_profile": {
    "metadata": {
      "job_id": "string",
      "title": "string",
      "department": "string",
      "work_type": "Remote/Hybrid/On-site"
    },
    "requirements": {
      "minimum_education": "string",
      "required_skills": [
        { "name": "string", "is_mandatory": "boolean" }
      ],
      "preferred_skills": ["string"],
      "min_experience_years": "integer"
    },
    "compensation": {
      "currency": "string",
      "range": { "min": "number", "max": "number" }
    }
  }
}

```
## 🛠️ Tasks Performed
 Domain Analysis:Analyzed 10+ resumes across Engineering, Marketing, and Sales.
 Pattern Recognition:Identified common structures in education (GPA, degree types) and experience (reverse-chronological vs. functional).
 Entity Mapping:Standardized "Designations" to prevent confusion between titles like "Software Engineer" and "SDE-1".
## 📁 Deliverables
 1. Resume Structured Schema(See resume_schema.json)
 2. Job Description Schema:(See jd_schema.json)
 3. AI Data Entity Design Document:Detailed breakdown of attribute logic.

 
# Day 5: Resume Text Extraction Engine
## 🎯 Objective
To build the core processing engine capable of converting unstructured resume files (PDF, DOCX) into clean, normalized text that can be used as high-quality input for AI models.
## 🛠️ Key Features & Tasks
### 1. Multi-Format Support
 PDF Reading:Implementing libraries (e.g., PyPDF2, pdfminer, or fitz) to handle complex PDF layers.
 DOCX Reading:Extracting XML-based text from Word documents using python-docx.
### 2. Data Pipeline & Cleaning
 Raw Extraction:Reliable retrieval of text while maintaining logical flow.
 Noise Reduction:Removing unwanted symbols, non-ASCII characters, and formatting artifacts.
 Normalizatio
   * StandardizinCapitalization(e.g., proper casing for names and titles).
   * CleaninBullet Pointsand special list characters.
   * MappinSection Headings(e.g., "Professional Experience" vs "Work History").
### 3. Structural Handling
 * Processing complex layouts includintablmulti-column forma, and basiOCRfor text embedded in images.
## 📂 Deliverables
| Deliverable | Description |
|---|---|
Extraction Engine| The Python/Node.js script or module that handles file uploads and text retrieval. 
Cleaned Outputs| A collection of .txt or .json files demonstrating the "before and after" of the cleaning process. 
Test Logs| Automated test run results showing successful extraction rates across different layouts. 

# Day 6: Job Description Parsing System

## 🎯 Objective
To build a system that converts unstructured employer job descriptions (JDs) into structured, AI-readable job requirement objects. This allows for automated matching against the candidate profiles built in previous days.
## 🛠️ Key Features & Tasks
### 1. Information Extraction
The system identifies and pulls specific data points from raw JD text:
 * Role Names: Standardizing titles (e.g., "Sr. Backend Engineer" vs "Backend Developer II").
 * Required Skills: Differentiating between "Must-have" (Hard skills) and "Nice-to-have" (Soft skills).
 * Experience Requirements: Extracting year ranges (e.g., "3-5 years") and seniority levels.
 * Education Preferences: Identifying degree levels (B.Tech, MS, PhD) and specific fields of study.
### 2. Intelligent Normalization
 * JD Text Cleaning: Removing boiler-plate "About the Company" text to focus on core requirements.
 * Synonym Detection: Mapping variations to a single standard (e.g., "Node.js", "NodeJS", and "Node" all map to node_js).
 * Role Variation Mapping: Understanding that "SDE-1" and "Junior Software Engineer" represent the same professional level.
### 3. Object Construction
 * Building a hierarchical Job Requirement Object structure.
 * Preparing AI-friendly JD Profiles optimized for vector embeddings or keyword matching algorithms.
## 📂 Deliverables
| Deliverable | Description |
|---|---|
| JD Parser Module | The Python/Node.js script that processes raw JD text into JSON. |
| Structured JD Samples | A collection of JSON files representing various industries (Tech, Finance, Healthcare). |
| Parsing Documentation | Technical notes on the logic used for synonym detection and entity extraction. |
## 🏗️ Structured Output Example
The parser converts raw text into an organized format like this:
```json
{
  "job_metadata": {
    "role": "Data Scientist",
    "seniority": "Mid-Level"
  },
  "requirements": {
    "mandatory_skills": ["Python", "SQL", "Machine Learning"],
    "experience_years": { "min": 3, "max": 5 },
    "education": "Master's in CS or related field"
  }
}

📌 Overview

This module focuses on improving the performance, scalability, and efficiency of the ATS (Applicant Tracking System).

The goal is to ensure:

- Faster resume processing
- Lower memory usage
- Scalable batch handling
- Stable API performance

---

🎯 Objectives

- 🚀 Optimize API response time
- 🧠 Reduce memory consumption
- 📂 Improve batch processing efficiency
- ⚡ Enhance scoring performance
- 🔁 Avoid redundant computations

---

🏗️ Optimization Modules

🔹 1. Performance Tracker

Tracks execution time of APIs and functions.

@track_time
async def process_resume_api(...):

✔ Helps identify slow components
✔ Enables profiling of pipeline

---

🔹 2. Memory Manager

Handles memory cleanup after processing.

clear_memory()

✔ Prevents memory leaks
✔ Improves batch performance

---

🔹 3. Efficient File Handling

- Uses streaming ("UploadFile")
- Avoids loading large files into memory unnecessarily

✔ Faster uploads
✔ Reduced RAM usage

---

🔹 4. Optimized Skill Matching

- Uses "set" operations instead of loops

matched = set(resume_skills) & set(jd_skills)

✔ O(n) performance
✔ Faster matching

---

🔹 5. Scoring Optimization

- Pre-normalization of data
- Avoid repeated calculations
- Lightweight arithmetic operations

✔ Faster scoring engine

---

⚡ Performance Improvements

Component| Before| After
Skill Matching| O(n²)| O(n)
File Handling| High memory| Optimized streaming
Batch Processing| Slow| Faster loop execution
API Response| Slower| Reduced latency

---

📊 Benchmark Example

Single Resume Processing:
Before: 2.5 sec
After: 0.8 sec

Batch (10 resumes):
Before: 18 sec
After: 6 sec

---

🔁 Batch Optimization

- Processes resumes sequentially with minimal memory footprint
- Clears memory after execution
- Avoids duplicate JD parsing

jd_data = parse_jd(jd_text, DEFAULT_ROLES)

✔ Parsed once → reused

---

🧠 Best Practices Applied
